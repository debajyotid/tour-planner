Our system combines real-time weather data, local attractions information, and personalized preferences to generate detailed travel itineraries.\n\n## Key Features\n- Personalized itinerary generation based on:\n    - Destination\n    - Date range  \n    - Budget constraints\n    - Personal interests\n    - Local weather conditions\n    - Popular tourist attractions\n- Interactive refinement through natural conversation\n- Integration with Google Maps API for location data\n- Real-time weather updates via OpenWeather API\n\n## Technical Implementation\nThe system is built using:\n- OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 model for natural language processing\n- LangChain for managing conversation history and context\n- Google Maps API for location and attraction data\n- OpenWeather API for weather forecasts\n- Python libraries: pandas, ipywidgets\n\n## How It Works\n1. Users input their travel preferences including destination, dates, and interests\n2. The system fetches real-time data about local attractions and weather\n3. An AI-generated itinerary is created based on all inputs\n4. Users can refine the itinerary through natural conversation with the AI\n\n## Practical Applications\nThis tool demonstrates the power of combining:\n- Large Language Models (LLMs)\n- Real-time data integration\n- Conversational AI\n- API orchestration\n\nPerfect for travel agencies, individual travelers, or anyone looking to plan a detailed, personalized trip.","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-16T15:23:43.53262Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-16T15:23:43.532927Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-16T15:23:43.538963Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-16T15:23:43.532906Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-16T15:23:43.537973Z"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### In the below cells we will look to leverage the capabilities of OpenAI's \"gpt-3.5-turbo-0125\" model to build a smart Trip-planner, which takes as input a trip destination of your choice, trip start and end dates, and your estimated budget for the trip.
